**ðŸ§ª Experiment 5: Decision Statements in C++**

**âœ… Aim:**

To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of decision-making (selection) statements such as if, if-else, else-if ladder, and switch-case.

**ðŸ§  Theory:
**
In C++, decision statements are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to make choices and execute specific blocks of code depending on the result (true or false) of a given condition.

C++ supports the following types of decision statements:
